## Learnings


### Never run `pnpm run dev`
user will run the dev server manually.

### Don't hallucinate track URLs
use `"YOUR_URL_HERE"` or existing URLs when making track configs.


### Keep implementation simple and concise

Avoid over-engineering and obvious documentation. Users prefer minimal, direct solutions over comprehensive but redundant docs. Remove sections that don't add unique value.
